When it comes to styling buttons there are a variety of approaches. Should the button be minimalist, 
or should the button mimic a piece of hardware coming off of your webpage? The answer depends on what you 
want your user to do. If the “call to action” on your page is a button, then that button should stand out 
against everything else on the page. Sometimes you may not want a button to scream, “CLICK ME!” at your 
users and there are plenty of ways to accomplish this too.  

I am going to cover 2 methods for styling buttons with gradients in this post. The CSS propert border-image 
can make your button pop, yet remain subtle enough not to disrupt your composition. However, the border-image 
property has some limitations, so I am going to cover another property that is useful: background-image. Yes, 
background-image is also useful for styling buttons and it is quite handy when you want your button to pop 
off the page.


## Gradients on Buttons using the Border Image Property

```css
.button { 
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 4px;
    border-image: linear-gradient
        (180deg, rgb(170,225,255) 33%, 
            rgb(100,190,255) 84%,
            rgb(50,140,255) 100%
        ) 1; /* Pay close attention to this 1 */

    width: 180px;
    padding: 15px;
}
```


```html
    <button class="button">Border Image</button>
```

### Limitations

The border-radius property doesn’t work as expected on borders styled with the border-image property.

Opera Mini only provides partial support for border-image.
