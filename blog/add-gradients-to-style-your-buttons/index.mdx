When it comes to styling buttons there are a variety of approaches. Should the button be minimalist, or should 
the button mimic a piece of hardware coming off of your webpage? The answer depends on what you want your user 
to do. If the “call to action” on your page is a button, then that button should stand out against everything 
else on the page. Sometimes you may not want a button to scream, “CLICK ME!” at your users and there are plenty 
of ways to accomplish this too.   

I am going to cover 2 methods for styling buttons with gradients in this post. The CSS property, border-image, 
can make your button pop, yet remain subtle enough not to disrupt your composition. However, the border-image 
property has some limitations, so I will cover another helpful property: background-image. Yes, background-image 
is also useful for styling buttons and is quite handy when you want your button to pop off the page.

## Gradients on Buttons using the Border Image Property

```css
.button { 
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 4px;
    border-image: linear-gradient
        (180deg, rgb(170, 225, 255) 33%, 
            rgb(100, 190, 255) 67%, 
            rgb(50, 140, 255) 91%, 
            rgb(25, 70, 200) 100%
        ) 1; /* Pay close attention to this 1 */

    width: 180px;
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: transparent;
}
```


```html
    <button class="button">Border Image</button>
```

This will create a basic button with border with a gradient and a transparent background.

<GridStructure 
    modifier={13}
    itemCount={1}
    extension={'png'} />

### Considerations

Accessibility is also another crucial factor of web development. You can ensure that the colors
and font size you are using to create a high enough contrast ratio [here](https://accessible-colors.com/).
 
It is also important to consider the transparent background of this button and how that may work
on your composition under normal circumstances. This button will work better on a white background. But
that may not be the case on every website so let's add a background to this button.


```css
.button { 
    /* Previous code . . . */

    background-color: linear-gradient
        (0deg, rgb(210, 210, 210) 10%, 
            rgb(230, 230, 230) 30%, 
            rgb(240, 240, 240) 80%, 
            rgb(255, 255, 255) 88%
        );
}
```
#### Or

```css
    .button { 
    /* Previous code . . . */

    background-color: linear-gradient(
            rgb(170,225,255) 33%, 
            rgb(100,190,255) 67%, 
            rgb(50, 140,255) 91%, 
            rgb(25,70,200) 100%
        );
}
```
<GridStructure 
    modifier={14}
    itemCount={2}
    extension={'png'} />

This fixes problems that can arise from transparency. Users may oftentimes have night-mode plugins
on their browsers that may hide some content or make some things difficult to see.

### Limitations

The border-radius property doesn’t work as expected on borders styled with the border-image 
property. There's a complex way to get around this issue, but I will not be going over that 
here.

Opera Mini, UC (Android), QQ, Baidu, and KaiOS Browsers only provide partial support for 
border-image with associated properties and values. For updates on border-image browser support
check [here](https://caniuse.com/border-image).

## Gradients on Buttons using the Background Image Property

```css
.button-double-border { 
    width: 231px;
    height: 77px;
    padding: 9px;

    border: double 1px transparent;    
    border-radius: 50px;
    background-image: linear-gradient
        (180deg, rgb(210, 210, 210) 10%, 
            rgb(230, 230, 230) 30%, 
            rgb(240, 240, 240) 80%, 
            rgb(255, 255, 255) 88%
        ), 
        linear-gradient
        (180deg, rgb(170, 225, 255) 33%, 
            rgb(100, 190, 255) 67%, 
            rgb(50, 140,255) 91%, 
            rgb(25, 70, 200) 100%
        );
    background-origin: border-box;
    background-clip: content-box, border-box;
}
```
```html
    <button class="button-double-border">Background Image</button>
```
Using a double border with the background-image property will allow you to create gradient borders 
while incorporating the border-radius property into the design.

With buttons like these, I like to control the absolute size using the height and width properties. Border
thickness can be controlled with the padding property. More padding means a thicker border.

Play with the background-origin and background-clip properties to see how those are vital for this component’s style. 
Using the background-origin property will ensure that both images will start in the upper-left-most boundary of the 
element. Without the background-clip property, the internal gradient wouldn’t have limits and thus expand to fill 
the element into its border. Removing this feature would cover our border gradient leaving only the gray/white 
background visible.
