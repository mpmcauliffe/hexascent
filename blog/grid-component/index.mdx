*from 'You don’t need a media query for that — #2 Responsive Columns'*

When it comes to building flexible responsive layouts we’ve relied on media
queries for quite some time, but did you know that you may not actually need
them?


## A quick tip

Using CSS grid we can create a list of cards that automatically fit and resize
to the available space with just three lines of CSS. Specifically, the
following three lines:

```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(230px, 1fr));
grid-gap: 9px;
```

You can just stop here and view the Codepen, or you can carry on and I’ll explain what is going on.

<GridStructure
