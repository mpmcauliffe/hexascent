## What is coding? 

Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we
communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and
writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code,
you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You
can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of
other cool things.


## Why learn how to code? 

We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future.
Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current
job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to
your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!

## What Does Web Development Mean?

Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing
websites for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process
includes web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting
and network security configuration, among other tasks.

In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, and
operations required to build, maintain and manage a website to ensure its
performance, user experience, and speed are optimal.

It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic actions needed
to ensure its proper ranking on search engine results. Usually, those tasks
pertain to a different specialization, namely search engine optimization (SEO)

Web development is also known as website development, while the professionals
that maintain a website are called web developers or (more commonly) web devs.

## Techopedia Explains Web Development

Web development is the coding or programming that enables website
functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the
non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing
markup.

Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based
applications, social network applications and electronic business applications.

The web development hierarchy is as follows:

* Client-side coding.
* Server-side coding.
* Database technology.

Most web devs use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS), and JavaScript to develop websites.

HTML defines the basic framework of a website – the foundation upon which
everything else is built upon. It forms the blocks that define a page’s layout,
format, and critical components. Although it is theoretically possible to code
a website on HTML only, it will be just a barebone site with no functions
unless it’s enriched with CSS and JavaScript. Also, even simple style
modifications such as changing the color of a button require a lot of coding to
be executed using HTML only.

CSS is used to style the content of a website using a small set of files that
are kept across the entire site. This way, whenever a change must be applied to
say, consistently change the color of all the buttons found in every page of
the website, a web dev needs to edit only a single file in CSS.

The JavaScript programming language is used to take care of the interactivity
of many unique website elements. It can be used to create effects that alter
the appearance of icons and drop-down menus, add animations, games, and other
interactive elements.

Web developers are usually divided into front-end devs, back-end devs, and
full-stack devs. A front-end dev takes care of all the visual aspects of the
website (layout, navigation bar, etc.), its interactivity, and binds together
all its elements.

Back-end devs take care of less visible tasks that ensure the website runs
smoothly, such as managing the website’s hosting services, database, and
applications. Back-end devs might need to engineer solution to server issues by
using additional server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, and PHP.

Full-stack devs are developers able to do both front-end and back-end tasks at
the same time.
