When React code is transpiled into browser-readable javascript, JSX goes
through a few transformations before it is seen in the browser. Build
directories are restructured and files are indexed differently in production.
This transformation exposes the possibility of hazards when dealing with
different types of modules.

Developers use toolchains such as Create React App (CRA), and Next.js use
Webpack as a bundler to assist with module integration. There are minor
differences between versions of Webpack and CRA that affect src attribute in an
image tag. Aside from those minor tweeks, there are 3 main ways to utilize an
image in React.

* Import our image as a module
* Require our image inline 
* Accessing images in the public directory, the 'escape hatch'

## Import our Image as a Module

Once our image is imported, the imported variable can be set as the value of the src attribute
in an image tag.

```jsx
import beautifulMountians from './images/beautifulMountians.jpg';

const FavoriteImages = () => (
    <>
        <h1>My Favorite Mountian!</h1>
        
        <img 
            alt='beautiful-mount'
            src={beautifulMountians} />
    </>
);

export default FavoriteImages;
```
<p align='center'>My Favorite Mountian!</p>
<GridStructure 
    modifier={8}
    itemCount={1}
    extension={'jpg'} />

### Considerations for Importing our Image

This is an easy way to display our image, but if we needed to share multiple images, 
this method wouldn't be as practical.

## Require our Image Inline

## Using the Public Directory â€” The Escape Hatch
