When React code is transpiled into browser-readable javascript, JSX goes
through a few transformations before it is seen in the browser. Build
directories are restructured and files are indexed differently in production.
This transformation exposes the possibility of hazards when dealing with
different types of modules.

Developers use toolchains such as Create React App (CRA), and Next.js use
Webpack as a bundler to assist with module integration. There are minor
differences between versions of Webpack and CRA that affect src attribute in an
image tag. Aside from those minor tweeks, there are 3 main ways to utilize an
image in React.

* Import an image as a module
* Require an image inline 
* Accessing images in the public directory, the 'escape hatch'

## Import an Image as a Module

Once the image is imported, the imported variable can be set as the value of the src attribute
in an image tag.

```jsx
import beautifulMountians from './images/beautifulMountians.jpg';

const FavoriteImages = () => (
    <>
        <p>My Favorite Mountian!</p>
        
        <img 
            alt='beautiful-mount'
            src={beautifulMountians} />
    </>
);

export default FavoriteImages;
```

<BrokenLine thickness={2} />

<p align='center'>My Favorite Mountian!</p>
<GridStructure 
    modifier={8}
    itemCount={1}
    extension={'jpg'} />

<BrokenLine thickness={2} />

### Considerations for Importing an Image

This is an easy way to display an image, but this wouldn't be practical for
importing many images. This method also has limitations for displaying images 
dynamically. There are many other solutions to such problems coming up. 

<BrokenLine thickness={5} /> 

## Require an image inline

```jsx

const FavoriteImages = () => (
    <>
        <p>My Favorite Mountian!</p>
        
        <img 
            alt='beautiful-mount'
            src={require('./images/beautifulMountians.jpg')} />
    </>
);

export default FavoriteImages;
```

<BrokenLine thickness={2} />

There may be issues using *require* in this way. Specific to older versions of react scripts, you may need
to reference the .default key. You can read more about this issue [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9992).

```jsx
<img 
    alt='beautiful-mount'
    src={require('./images/beautifulMountians.jpg').default} />
```

### You Actually CAN Import Multiple Images

Javascript modules are robust so there are many ways they can be used to overcome
challenges. The power of *import* can be combined with the power of *require*. 
Take this file tree, for instance:

```CSS
├── src/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── bear1.jpg
    │   ├── bear2.jpg
    │   └── index.js
    ├── App.js
    └── …
```

Images can be exported as an object in images/index.js

```javascript
    // index.js
    const images = {
        bear1: require('../images/bear1.jpg'),
        bear2: require('../images/bear2.jpg'),
    }

    export default images
```

<BrokenLine thickness={2} />

The *images* object may now be imported in App.js. 

```jsx
import images from './images';

const FavoriteImages = () => (
    <>
        <p>BEARS!</p>
        
        <img 
            alt='bear1'
            src={images.bear1} />
        <img 
            alt='bear2'
            src={images.bear2} />
    </>
);

export default FavoriteImages;
```

<p align='center'>Bears!</p>
<GridStructure 
    modifier={2}
    itemCount={2}
    extension={'jpg'} />

<BrokenLine thickness={5} /> 

## Using the Public Directory — The Escape Hatch

This option works with CRA and Next.js. CRA refers to this as an escape hatch and 
emphasizes that it should be used rarely. The file tree may be different in your app,
but the premise is the same.

```CSS
├── public/
    ├── images/
        └── spookyTown.jpg
├── scr/
    ├── App.js
    └── …
```

The *public* directory can be accessed using the **process.env.PUBLIC_URL** environment
variable.

```jsx
const FavoriteImages = () => (
    <>
        <p>Spooky Town</p>
        
        <img 
            alt='spooky-town'
            src={process.env.PUBLIC_URL + '/images/spookyTown.jpg'} />
    </>
);

export defualt FavoriteImages;
```

<p align='center'>Spooky Town</p>
<GridStructure 
    modifier={17}
    itemCount={1}
    extension={'jpg'} />
