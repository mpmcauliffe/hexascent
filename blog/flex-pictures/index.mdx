*from CSS Tricks*

The flex-wrap property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module.

It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can be flowed into 
multiple lines. If set to multiple lines, it also defines the cross-axis which determines 
the direction new lines are stacked in.

Reminder: the cross axis is the axis perpendicular to the main axis. 
Its direction depends on the main axis direction.

The flex-wrap property accepts 3 different values:

* nowrap (default): single-line which may cause the container to overflow
* wrap: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction
* wrap-reverse: multi-lines, opposite to direction defined by flex-direction
